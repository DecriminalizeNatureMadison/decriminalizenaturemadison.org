      Hello
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm reaching out because I would like to see the City of Madison decriminalize entheogenic plants and fungi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research has shown that entheogens (such as psilocybin) are safe and non-addictive. In fact, studies have found that entheogens can help improve mental health, promote empathy, and kickstart positive life changes. Despite this, Wisconsin applies felony punishments to most entheogen law!
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Madison wouldn't be the first city to decriminalize entheogenic plants and fungi. Minneapolis, Detroit and Ann Arbor have all decriminalized recently.
    </p>
    <p>
      I encourage you to consider supporting and working with the local movement to decriminalize entheogens, Decriminalize Nature Madison. You can visit their website at <a href="https://dnmadison.org">https://dnmadison.org</a> for more information on entheogens and their benefits. You can also email them at <a href="mailto:contact@dnmadison.org">contact@dnmadison.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for your consideration
    </p>
