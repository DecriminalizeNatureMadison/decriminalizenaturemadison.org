### Who are we?
Decriminalize Nature Madison is the decriminalization activism branch of the [Madison Psychedelic
Society](https://www.meetup.com/madison-psychedelic-society/). We advocate for the safe and responsible
decriminalization of entheogenic plants and fungi in the City of Madison, WI.

### What do we do?
We organize events where people get together and help advocate for decriminalization. Right now,
we are preparing our resources to begin speaking with the public and city officials.
