## Decriminalization Social and Crafts at The High Crowd!

Come join us at The High Crowd for a fun social night centered around our local movement to decriminalize entheogenic (aka psychedelic) plants and mushrooms in Madison!

Meet like-minded people, learn more about the movement, and get involved! We will have a variety of fun themed swag such as stickers and buttons available to make, take and show your support!

**Come when you can, leave when you'd like!** This event is drop-in friendly :).

For more information, please email Eric at eric.w0spz@simplelogin.com.

From the [Daily Cardinal article](https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2023/10/the-high-crowd-cafe-is-madisons-thc-oasis):
"The cafe is not the first store to open in Madison that sells THC legally, as THC stores can be found throughout the town. However, the High Crowd Cafe is unique because it sells beverages and food infused with THC and CBD, an experience unlike many of Madison's other cafes.
"High Crowd could be a new breakthrough in the Madison social scene, as it provides an alternative to “going out” and drinking alcohol. While there may be some concerns about the cafe’s presence and the accessibility of its products to the student body, customers must be 21 years or older to purchase the THC-infused products.
"High Crowd also may raise confusion due to the status of marijuana's legality in Wisconsin. While marijuana may not be legal, THC-infused products can still be bought and sold when they are derived from hemp plants."
