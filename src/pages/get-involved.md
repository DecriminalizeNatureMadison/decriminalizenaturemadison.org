The quickest and easiest way to help is to contact your local elected officials to let them know that this is an issue
that is important to you. If you live in the City of Madison, we would suggest contacting your local district alder. You can
find their contact information using the ["Find My Alder" tool available on the City of Madison website](https://www.cityofmadison.com/council/councilmembers/findalderbyaddress.cfm).

If you don't live in the City of Madison, but you do live in Dane County, we would suggest contacting the [Dane County District
Attorney's Office](https://da.danecounty.gov/). You can reach them at [(608) 266-4211](tel:6082664211) or [danecoda@da.wi.gov](mailto:danecoda@da.wi.gov).

If you'd like to get involved in our outreach and events, check out the [Madison Psychedelic Society events
page](https://www.meetup.com/madison-psychedelic-society/)! That's where you will find Decriminalize Nature Madison events as well
as events from the wider psychedelic society. If you would like to get involved in a different way, please reach out to
us through [our contact form](/contact).
